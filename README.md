# wordfrequency
Basically a word frequency counter, that gets the content written in the block of text by the user, it shows in a table, each word individually and it counts the frequency of them.


Inspired by https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas 
NOTE: Just like the "basicalculator", this project will not implement everything that is on the app-ideas repository (specially the frontend) and is only for learning purposes as well.
